# Introduction
{:.no_toc}

In this training you're going to make an assembly of data produced by
"Complete Genome Sequences of Eight Methicillin-Resistant
Staphylococcus aureus Strains Isolated from Patients in
Japan" from {% cite Hikichi_2019 %} which describes:

> Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) is a major pathogen
causing nosocomial infections, and the clinical manifestations of MRSA
range from asymptomatic colonization of the nasal mucosa to soft tissue
infection to fulminant invasive disease. Here, we report the complete
genome sequences of eight MRSA strains isolated from patients in Japan.

# Background

Sequencing (determining of DNA/RNA nucleotide sequence) is used all over
the world for all kinds of analysis. The product of these sequencers are
reads, which are sequences of detected nucleotides. Depending on the
technique these have specific lengths (30-500bp) or using Oxford
Nanopore Technologies sequencing have much longer variable lengths.

# Quality Control

When assessing the fastq files all bases had their own quality (or Phred score)
represented by symbols. You can read more in our dedicated [Quality Control
Tutorial]({% link topics/sequence-analysis/tutorials/quality-control/tutorial.md %}).

To assess the quality by hand would be too much work. That's why tools like
[NanoPlot](https://github.com/wdecoster/NanoPlot) or
[FastQC](http://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc/) are made,
which will generate a summary and plots of the data statistics. NanoPlot is
mainly used for long-read data, like ONT and PACBIO and FastQC for short read,
like Illumina and Sanger.

DRR187559_1 | DRR187559_2
----------- | -----------
![FastQC plot showing reads that mostly stay in the green](../../images/mrsa/fastqc-1.png) | ![Same as previous plot, but the beginning of the reads are slightly better quality](../../images/mrsa/fastqc-2.png)

FastQC combines all quality statistics from all separate reads and combines them in plots. An important plot is the Per base sequence quality. Here you have the reads sequence length on the x-axes against the quality score (Phred-score) on the y-axis. The y-axis is divided in three sections: Green = good quality, Orange = mediocre quality and red = bad quality. For Illumina data it is normal that the first few bases are of some lower quality and how longer the reads get the worse the quality becomes. This is often due to signal decay or phasing during the sequencing run.

For each position, a boxplot is drawn with:

- the median value, represented by the central red line
- the inter-quartile range (25-75%), represented by the yellow box
- the 10% and 90% values in the upper and lower whiskers
- the mean quality, represented by the blue line

Depending on the analysis it could be possible that a certain quality or length is needed. In this case weâ€™re going to trim the data using Trimmomatic.

# Assembly

When the quality of the reads is determined and the data is filtered and/or
trimmed an assembly can be made. There are many tools that create assembly for
long-read data, but in this tutorial Shovill will be used. Shovill is a SPAdes
based genome assembler, improved to work faster and only for smaller
(bacterial) genomes.

## QC

[Quast](http://quast.bioinf.spbau.ru/) ({% cite Gurevich2013% %})
is a tool providing quality metrics for assemblies, and can also be used
to compare multiple assemblies. The tool can also take an optional
reference file as input, and will provide complementary metrics. QUAST
stands for QUality ASsessment Tool. With later updates gene annotation
also possible with QUAST.

This fasta file contains 32 contigs, meaning the chromosome is separated over multiple contigs. These contigs can also contain (parts of) plasmids.

# Identification of AMR Genes

Because we are working with a MRSA we are curious to see which resistance genes are located on the genome or on the plasmid. To determine whether the contigs contain antimicrobial resistance (AMR) genes [staramr](https://github.com/phac-nml/staramr) can be used  **Staramr** scans bacterial genome contigs against both the **ResFinder** ({% cite Zankari2012 %}), **PointFinder** ({% cite Zankari2017 %}), and **PlasmidFinder** ({% cite Carattoli2014 %}) databases (used by the ResFinder webservice) and compiles a summary report of detected antimicrobial resistance genes.

>    - For the plasmid and resistance results the identity, overlap, length and the location on the contig can be found here.
>    - Multiple rep sequences are located on the second contig. (See "plasmid typing for gram-positive bacteria" {% cite Lozano_2012 %} for more information)

## CARD database

To get more information about these antibiotic resistant genes, you can check the [CARD database](https://card.mcmaster.ca) (**C**omprehensive **A**ntibiotic **R**esistance **D**atabase) ({% cite Jia2016 %})

![Screenshot of mecA sequence in CARD database with lots of metadata](../../images/mrsa/card.png "Screenshot of the CARD database interface. CARD gives information about the antibiotic resistance genes, as well as links to relevant publications.")

CARD can be very helpful to check all the resistance genes and check if
it is logical to find the resistance gene in a specific bacteria.

> ### {% icon question %} Question

## Gene annotation using Prokka

[Prokka](https://github.com/tseemann/prokka/blob/master/README.md) is a
tool software tool to rapidly annotate bacterial, archaeal and viral
genomes. Prokka will be used on your own made genome (assembly). Prokka
will try to annotate the bacteria based on related species and starting
codons can be chosen or default of the species can be used.

[JBrowse](https://jbrowse.org/docs/tutorial.html) is used to visualize
your genome file and merge multiple outputs.\
In this case you will use your assembly as your reference and the output
from prokka as an information track.

In the output of the JBrowse you can view the mapped reads and the found genes against the reference genome. With the search tools you can easily find genes of interest. JBrowse can handle many inputs and can be very useful. Using the bowtie2 mapping output, low coverage regions can be detected. This SNP detection can also give a clear view of where the data was less reliable or where variations were located.

If it takes too long to build the JBrowse instance, you can view an embedded one here. (**Warning**: feature name search will not work.)
