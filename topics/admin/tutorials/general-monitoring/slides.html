## Manage Jobs

An admin interface to list current unfinished jobs and finished jobs of a certain age.

* You can stop unfinished jobs
* You can show details of old jobs
* You can lock the server from spawning new jobs. (e.g. for maintenance.)

---

# Log Files

- Galaxy logs (`/srv/galaxy/log/*`)
  - Web (uWSGI)
  - Handler
- nginx logs (`/var/log/nginx/*`)
- supervisor logs (`/var/log/supervisor/*`)

# Database Queries

Sometimes it's the best way to get the exact data you need

Can be very useful for:
- Debugging
- Reporting
- Analytics

But consider: [`gxadmin`](https://github.com/usegalaxy-eu/gxadmin) and sharing your SQL

# Database Queries

"Can you send me the number of jobs per day/state from Main in September and October?"

```sql
SELECT
  date_trunc('month', j.create_time) AS month,
  j.state,
  COUNT(j.state) AS job_count
FROM job j
LEFT OUTER JOIN galaxy_user u
  ON j.user_id = u.id
WHERE u.email != 'monitor@bx.psu.edu'
GROUP BY month,
         j.state
HAVING date_trunc('month', j.create_time) >= '2016-09-01'
AND date_trunc('month', j.create_time) < '2016-11-01'
ORDER BY month, j.state;
```

# Database Queries

```

# Database Queries

"I need a list of current main toolshed users and a number of their repos"

```
gxadmin query ts-repos
```

**OR**

```sql
SELECT
  u.username,
  COUNT(r.id) AS r_count
FROM galaxy_user u
JOIN repository r
  ON u.id = r.user_id
WHERE NOT r.deleted
GROUP BY u.id
ORDER BY r_count DESC
LIMIT 12;
```

# Analytics

Can we make better walltime decisions?

`scripts/runtime_stats.py`: Database-driven job runtime statistics

---

# Reports

Galaxy ships with its own app that reports usage (user, job, data, etc numbers)

---
# Nagios

General purpose tool for monitoring systems and services.

Galaxy-specific check in `contrib/nagios/`: Runs Galaxy jobs

---

# Sentry

* Motto: *"Stop hoping your users will report errors"*
* Error tracking and analysing tool.
* Galaxy has Sentry middleware that you can enable in configuration.

---
# Job Metrics

Galaxy can collect metrics on each job through configurable plugins in `job_metrics_conf.xml`.

Some plugins:
- `core`: Captures Galaxy slots, start and end of job, runtime
- `cpuinfo`: processor count for each job
- `env`: dump environment for each job
- `collectl`: monitor a wide array of system performance data

---

# Telegraf, InfluxDB, and Grafana

General purpose tools for monitoring systems and services.

Tool     | Use
---      | ---
[Telegraf](https://github.com/influxdata/telegraf) | plugin-driven server agent for collecting & reporting metrics
[Influxdb](https://github.com/influxdata/influxdb/) | purpose built time series database
[Grafana](https://grafana.com/)  | dashboard for beautiful analytics and monitoring

Dataflow:

- Galaxy produces data
- Telegraf consumes and buffers it, before sending it to
- InfluxDB which stores the data
- And Grafana is used to visualise it

---
# Infrastructure for Grafana

* Everything captured in Galaxy Ansible [infrastructure-playbook](https://github.com/galaxyproject/infrastructure-playbook/) repository.
* Ansible [playbook](https://github.com/dj-wasabi/ansible-telegraf) to install Telegraf.
* Ansible [tasks](https://github.com/galaxyproject/infrastructure-playbook/blob/master/roles/stats/tasks/redhat.yml) for installing influxdb and grafana.

---
# Grafana showcase

* usegalaxy.eu [public server](https://stats.usegalaxy.eu)
* usegalaxy.org.au [public server](https://stats.genome.edu.au)
* usegalaxy.org private server

If you see a dashboard you can export its configuration and put it on your Grafana with your data. Copy away!
