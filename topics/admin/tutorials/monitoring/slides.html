# Telegraf, InfluxDB, and Grafana

General purpose tools for monitoring systems and services.

Tool     | Use
---      | ---
[Telegraf](https://github.com/influxdata/telegraf) | plugin-driven server agent for collecting & reporting metrics
[Influxdb](https://github.com/influxdata/influxdb/) | purpose built time series database
[Grafana](https://grafana.com/)  | dashboard for beautiful analytics and monitoring

Dataflow:

- Galaxy produces data
- Telegraf consumes and buffers it, before sending it to
- InfluxDB which stores the data
- And Grafana is used to visualise it

# Infrastructure for Grafana

* Everything captured in Galaxy Ansible [infrastructure-playbook](https://github.com/galaxyproject/infrastructure-playbook/) repository.
* Ansible [playbook](https://github.com/dj-wasabi/ansible-telegraf) to install Telegraf.
* Ansible [tasks](https://github.com/galaxyproject/infrastructure-playbook/blob/master/roles/stats/tasks/redhat.yml) for installing influxdb and grafana.

If you see a dashboard you can export its configuration and put it on your Grafana with your data. Copy away!
